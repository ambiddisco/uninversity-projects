# First Year Data Project: Text Based Speech Analysis by Age Using WhatsApp
This directory contains a large part of the code used in the university project on speech analysis by Group G, by Bernacchia, Biddiscombe and Maschinkiy.

The code is divided into part A, for the creation and cleaning of the datasets, and part B, for the visualisation and statistic calculation.

Note that the initial chat datasets which are referenced in part A have been removed for anonimity and data privacy rasons, along with some other pieces of private information, leaving part part A unrunnable in its current state.
